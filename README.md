# Game Assets Tool with Generative AI

## About This Project

This project leverages generative AI and automation tools to streamline the creation of game assets. It combines multiple technologies to generate images, convert them into 3D models, and automate tasks in a user-friendly window application.

### Technologies Used:
- **Stable Diffusion** – Generate high-quality 2D images using AI.
- **Monster Mash** – Convert 2D images into simple 3D models.
- **Selenium** – Automate browser interactions for asset processing.
- **Pygame** – Build an interactive window application for user control.

This is a work-in-progress project, and contributions or feedback are welcome!
